          I am learning Compter Science at the <a href= "http://www.salford.ac.uk">University of Salford</a>.
          I decided to study my course at Salford because: I was recommended to attend this university. At the bottom of this page you will find some of my favourite quotes and sayings.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The staff are <em>so</em> friendly.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is easy to get to by train.
          </li>
          <li>
            They use GNU/Linux (some of the time)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          My Course is provided by the <a href="http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk"> School of Computing, Science & Engineering</a>, which is based in the Newton Building. The Newton Building was not built recently, and would benefit from some improvements. If it were my decision, I would: Remodel the halls and offices.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improve the lighting in the second floor computer labs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fix the heating!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Decorate the staff offices
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve the building entrance
          </li>
        </ul>
